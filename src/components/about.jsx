          <strong>Ghulaman e Siddiqui Akbar International</strong> is a platform dedicated to serving the Way of Allah and His Beloved Messenger, may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. We strive to uphold the true message of Islam by elaborating on the teachings of the Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaat and the reality of <em>tasawwuf</em> – through the blessing, prayers and guidance of our beloved Shaykh, Khwaja Mohammad Alauddin Siddiqui of Darbar Nerian Sharif.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The main objective of this website is to enlighten hearts with love for our Master, Guide and Beloved, the Messenger of Allah, and fill hearts with the inclination to follow his blessed Sunnah, emulate his blessed character and illuminate this world with the fruits of his blessed teachings. We live in a world which is in dire need of the true Prophetic way, which is pure beyond all suspicion and extremism, but is in truth the completion of absolute mercy.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Exchange abuse with goodness, and deliver mercy where harshness prevails. Stand for the truth even if it is against yourself. Empower the weak and defend the oppressed. Embody integrity, honesty and moral excellence. Be mercy. These are values which were given to us by the Messenger of Allah, may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him – and it is these values we must revive in ourselves today if we truly yearn for salvation.
